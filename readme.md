Luminary is a modern modpack for 1.19.3 built on the [Quilt]() mod loader which focuses on performance and ease of use.

## Why should you use Luminary?

- Built upon modern technologies.
- Optimized like no other.
- Save your time with sane defaults.
- *No-nonsense mod management. Only have the ones you truly want.* (coming soon)

### Feature List

- Completely client side - join your favourite
- Minimap support provided by [JourneyMap]().
- [Optifine]() parity - while you can not use Optifine with Luminary, you will definitely not be missing out with complete parity; some components are even known to be more performant than Optifine itself!
- Plenty of quality of life mods, such as:
	- [Quick Elytra](), allowing you to change your chestplate out for your elytra in one keystroke.
	- [ClickThrough]() - open your labelled chests easily,.
	- [Weather Changer]() - change your client-side weather in just one keystroke.
	- [Nether Coords]() - linking two nether portals has never been easier.
	- [Break Free]() - keep your progress breaking a block when you change tools.
	- [GammaUtils]() - modify your gamma with ease. Enable it with the apostrophe key and use your Page Up/Page Down keys to modify the gamma increase, or just stick with the default of 1500% - it is up to you.
	- [Fabrishot]() - take beautiful, 4k screenshots of your build by pressing F9.
	- [ShulkerBoxTooltip]() - view the contents of shulker boxes from your inventory by holding the shift key.
	- [Slot Swap]() - hold alt and use your scrollwheel to quickly swap your hotbar slot with one from your inventory.
	- [Shuffle]() - shuffle through blocks in your hotbar by pressing the Z	key and placing blocks, perfect for building!

And we manage all of this without sacrificing performance. In fact, we enhance it*! We do this by bundling plenty of optimisations, such as:

- [Starlight](), a complete rewrite to Minecraft's lighting engine which dramatically boosts FPS.
- [Krypton](), a mod which improves Minecraft's networking stack.
- [DynamicFPS](), a mod which frees up your computer's resources when Minecraft is not focused or hidden by throttling its rendering.
- [Lithium](), one of if not the most well known general-purpose optimisation mod for Minecraft.

\* official benchmarks coming soon
